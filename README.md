Term-Wipe
=========

AppleScript executable to clear the screen and buffer of Terminal and iTerm on OS X.

Should work on all versions of OS X. But not tested on anything but El Capitan.

Usage
-----

Just run `term-wipe` from a script or within your Terminal (or iTerm) to clear the screen and the screen buffer.


Rational
--------

I personally just like clearing the screen and buffer often much of the time. If you don't desire this I don't recommend getting used to behavoir. Simply using `clear` from BASH gives you much of the same benefits without clearing the history buffer which you may wish to check later. There is no history buffer to check after running `term-wipe`.
